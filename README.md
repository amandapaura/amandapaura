- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amandapaura

I began my professional journey after studying mathematics in graduate school, initially working as a real estate consultant. During this time, I became intrigued by data science and machine learning, which led me to pivot my career.
Five years into this new path, I realized my true passion lies in tackling real-world challenges and solving business problems. This realization drove me to specialize as a data analyst and data science, where I help companies address their issues through data-driven solutions.

I have background in statistics, SQL, Python, and machine learning. My expertise in feature engineering and feature selection, combined with my extensive experience in data science and machine learning, enables me to create intelligent products for digital businesses. 
My technical skills in SQL and Python allow me to write procedures, develop ETL processes for production, and leverage cloud computing to build scalable and efficient programming pipelines.

Additionally, I am a dedicated team worker who loves to share knowledge and learn collaboratively. I thrive on working with people, listening to their ideas, and encouraging them to discover the best in themselves. 
My leadership style focuses on bringing out the strengths of each team member, fostering a collaborative environment that results in exceptional teamwork.
